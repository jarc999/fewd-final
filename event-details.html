    <p class="P1">Welcome to the 2022 edition of the Capital District Yarn Festival -- CDYF, for short! On October 14th, yarn lovers from across the region will flock to the Altemont Fairgrounds for two days of activities, shopping, and fun. We are proud to represent makers and craftsman from the Capital region, creating a space to show their wares and network with other yarn and textile creators. The CDYF is an exeperience the whole family can enjoy, with food and entertainment on site, as well.</p>

    <p>CDYF offers regular classes and workshops throughout the weekend, lead by some of the finest yarnworkers in the region. Highlights include a scarfmaking tutorial from Andrea Borjas, and a guide to working with alternative materials, lead by Michael Marinn. </p>
    <p>Entertainment is a much-needed part of the CDYF, especially after a workshop. Feel free to relax and listen to our live folk bands, featuring Marlon Devreaux and Shania McCowell. Sound for the event is graciously donated by the Capital District Concert Hall.</p>
